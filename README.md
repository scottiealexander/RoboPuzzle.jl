```julia
import RoboPuzzle
RoboPuzzle.run()
```
Do not be alarmed if running `import RoboPuzzle` take a long time the first time it is run (it's dependencies - namely [PyPlot.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl) - need to be precompiled).

# Dependencies
Automatically downloaded and installed dependencies:
* [PyPlot.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl)
* [Acorn.jl](https://github.com/scottiealexander/Acorn.jl/tree/highlights-1.0) (specifically the *highlights-1.0* branch)
